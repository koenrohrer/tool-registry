Explain the architecture of this codebase, focusing on `$ARGUMENTS` if provided, or the entire project if no argument given.

Produce a concise overview covering:

1. **Purpose**: What this project/subsystem does in 1-2 sentences
2. **Stack**: Languages, frameworks, key dependencies
3. **Directory Structure**: What each top-level directory contains
4. **Data Flow**: How a typical request/operation moves through the system
5. **Key Abstractions**: The core interfaces, base classes, or patterns everything builds on
6. **Entry Points**: Where execution starts (main, routes, event handlers)
7. **Configuration**: How the system is configured (env vars, config files, CLI args)
8. **Testing**: How tests are organized and run

Keep it factual and concise. Use bullet points. Don't speculate — only describe what you can verify from the source code. Target ~200-400 lines of output.
