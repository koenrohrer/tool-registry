# Doc Co-Authoring Workflow

Guide users through collaborative document creation with a structured process.

## Process

### 1. Understand the Document

Before writing anything:
- What type of document is this? (spec, proposal, RFC, guide, README)
- Who is the audience?
- What decisions need to be made?
- What is the desired outcome?

### 2. Create an Outline

Build a skeleton first:
- Propose section headings based on document type
- Ask the user to confirm, reorder, or adjust
- Identify sections that need research vs. sections that need decisions

### 3. Draft Iteratively

Work section by section:
- Write a first pass of each section
- Present for feedback before moving on
- Incorporate changes immediately
- Flag areas where you need more information

### 4. Review and Polish

Once all sections are drafted:
- Check consistency across sections
- Verify all claims and references
- Ensure the document achieves its stated goal
- Polish language, formatting, and flow

## Document Types

### Technical Spec
- Problem statement, proposed solution, alternatives considered
- API design, data models, migration plan
- Security, performance, and testing considerations

### Proposal / RFC
- Motivation, detailed design, drawbacks
- Alternatives, prior art, unresolved questions

### Decision Document
- Context, decision drivers, considered options
- Decision outcome, consequences, action items

### User Guide
- Getting started, core concepts, common workflows
- Configuration reference, troubleshooting, FAQ
