Scaffold a new feature called `$ARGUMENTS` in this project.

1. Analyze the existing project structure to understand conventions:
   - File naming (camelCase, kebab-case, PascalCase)
   - Directory organization (by feature, by type, flat)
   - Test file patterns (co-located, separate test dir)
   - Export patterns (barrel files, direct imports)
   - Framework in use (React, Express, FastAPI, etc.)
2. Create the source file in the appropriate location following existing patterns
3. Create a corresponding test file with a basic test structure:
   - Import the module
   - One describe block matching the module name
   - One placeholder test case
4. If the project uses barrel files (index.ts/index.js), add the export
5. Show me a summary of what was created and where
