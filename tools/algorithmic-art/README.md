## What it does

Guides your agent through developing a unique aesthetic philosophy and expressing it through interactive p5.js visualizations. Uses parametric variation and controlled chaos guided by seeded randomness.

## Use cases

- Creating generative art and flow fields
- Building particle systems and procedural animations
- Exploring algorithmic patterns with interactive controls
- Producing unique visual outputs with reproducible seeds
