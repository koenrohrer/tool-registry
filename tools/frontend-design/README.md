# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that prioritize design quality over generic aesthetics.

## What it does

Guides your agent to build visually striking web components, pages, and applications with intentional design decisions. Emphasizes typography, color, motion, and spatial composition over cookie-cutter layouts.

## Use cases

- Building web components, landing pages, and dashboards
- Styling and beautifying existing web UIs
- Creating React components with polished design
- Generating HTML/CSS layouts with distinctive character

## Design principles

- Intentionality over intensity -- bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work
- Context-driven aesthetics -- understand purpose, audience, and tone before coding
- Distinctive typography, cohesive color palettes, purposeful motion
- Asymmetrical layouts, unexpected grids, generous spacing
