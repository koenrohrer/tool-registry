# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with real working code and exceptional attention to aesthetic details.

## Design Philosophy

- **Intentionality over intensity**: Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work -- the key is intentionality, not intensity.
- **Context-driven aesthetics**: Understand purpose, audience, tone, and constraints before writing code.
- **Differentiation focus**: Every design should have one memorable, unforgettable element.

## Aesthetic Priorities

### Typography
- Choose distinctive fonts that avoid generic defaults
- Pair display and body fonts thoughtfully
- Use font size, weight, and spacing as design tools

### Color & Theme
- Build cohesive palettes using CSS variables
- Use a dominant color with sharp accents
- Consider dark/light mode from the start

### Motion
- CSS animations and transitions for impactful moments
- Scroll-triggered interactions where appropriate
- Subtle hover states that reward exploration

### Spatial Composition
- Asymmetrical layouts and unexpected grids
- Generous whitespace as a design element
- Visual depth through layering and shadows

## What to Avoid

- Overused font families (system defaults without consideration)
- Cliched color schemes (generic gradients, stock palettes)
- Predictable layouts (centered-everything, uniform grids)
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

## Process

1. **Understand context** -- Who is this for? What emotion should it evoke?
2. **Choose a design direction** -- Pick one distinctive aesthetic thread
3. **Build with real code** -- HTML, CSS, React, Tailwind -- whatever fits
4. **Refine details** -- Hover states, transitions, spacing, typography polish
5. **Verify quality** -- Does it look intentional? Would a designer approve?
